==================

Robotics Systems Type Library with FlexiMon Extensions

A collection of common and device specific data types for Robotics and Cognitive Systems specified in Google Protocol Buffer's IDL format and a build infrastructure for generating directly usable shared objects.

Shared type specifications are essential for achieving re-usability at the data and the component-level. Hence, the RST project aims at collecting typical data types in the context of intelligent (robotics) systems. From the IDL-based type specifications, shared libraries for Java, C++, Python and Common Lisp are build which are directly usable within RSB components.

The upstream project is hosted at CoR-Lab's [open source server](http://code.cor-lab.org/).
