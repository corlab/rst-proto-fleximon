==================

Robotics Systems Type Library with FlexiMon Extensions

A collection of common and device specific data types for Robotics and Cognitive Systems specified in Google Protocol Buffer's IDL format and a build infrastructure for generating directly usable shared objects.

Shared type specifications are essential for achieving re-usability at the data and the component-level. Hence, the RST project aims at collecting typical data types in the context of intelligent (robotics) systems. From the IDL-based type specifications, shared libraries for Java, C++, Python and Common Lisp are build which are directly usable within RSB components.

Installation and Usage with Maven
=================================

Generally, RST can be configured and build as described in the upstream project (see links below).

To utilize this specific RST version from Java, it has to be deployed in a local Maven repository.

To do so, issue the following commands in RST/build-directory/java:

<pre>
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=rst-0.11.0.jar -DgroupId=rsb -DartifactId=rst-fleximon -Dversion=0.11-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=rstsandbox-0.11.0.jar -DgroupId=rsb -DartifactId=rst-sandbox-fleximon -Dversion=0.11-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar
</pre>

Pre-built packages for this repository are available from CoR-Lab's CI Server:

* [rst-sandbox.jar](https://ci.cor-lab.de/job/rst-fleximon/label=ubuntu_precise_64bit/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/java/rstsandbox-0.11.0.jar) [pom-sandbox0.11.0.xml](https://ci.cor-lab.de/job/rst-fleximon/label=ubuntu_precise_64bit/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/java/pom-sandbox0.11.0.xml)

The upstream project is hosted at CoR-Lab's [open source server](http://code.cor-lab.org/).
